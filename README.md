# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies
- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- Place your Titanic dataset CSV file (e.g., `train.csv`) in this folder

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the notebook instructions to load your dataset and build your model.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` for Python package requirements.

## Dataset
Download the Titanic dataset (e.g., from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)) and place the CSV file in this directory.
